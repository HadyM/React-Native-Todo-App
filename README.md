# React-Native-Todo-App:

---

A modern mobile friendly ToDo Application. Designed using React-Native and JavaScript. The App provides a list that is color based, the higher up on the list the darker the color and lower down the list the lighter the color gets. I designed the application this way so the user can start with the highest priority first and then organize what's least prioity further down and not get confused on what is more important versus what is not!!
